# Palindrome Pain

https://www.codechef.com/problems/PALINPAIN

You are given two integers X and Y. You need to construct two different strings S1 and S2 consisting of only the characters ‘a′ and ‘b′, such that the following conditions are satisfied:

1. Both S1 and S2 are palindromes.
2. Both S1 and S2 should contain exactly X occurrences of a and Y occurrences of b.

If there are multiple possible answers, you may print any of them. If it is not possible to construct two distinct strings satisfying the conditions, print -1 instead
