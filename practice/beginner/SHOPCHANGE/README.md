# Shopping Change

https://www.codechef.com/problems/SHOPCHANGE

Chef went shopping and bought items worth X rupees (1≤X≤100). Unfortunately, Chef only has a single 100 rupees note.

Since Chef is weak at maths, can you help Chef in calculating what money he should get back after paying 100 rupees for those items?
